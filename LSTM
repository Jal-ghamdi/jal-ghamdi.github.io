# Long Short Term Memory
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) stands as a sophisticated and transformative advancement within the realm of neural networks, particularly in the field of natural language processing (NLP). 
In essence, LSTM addresses the inherent challenge of modeling sequential data, such as language, by effectively capturing and retaining long-range dependencies within sequences. 
Unlike conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which often struggle with vanishing or exploding gradients that hinder the learning of distant dependencies, LSTM introduces a dynamic 
memory cell and specialized gating mechanisms to circumvent these limitations. This allows LSTM to effectively capture context and relationships across time steps, making it particularly well-suited 
for tasks involving sequences of variable lengths. By integrating memory cells that retain information over extended intervals, and employing gating units that regulate the flow of information, LSTM 
has significantly enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of various natural language processing applications, marking it as a cornerstone in modern deep learning architectures.
Within the context of NLP, each word within a document's sequence is represented as a vector. As a result, LSTM operates on sequences of vectors corresponding to words in the document.
# Inner Workings of LSTM
Comprising three control neural networks - fn, in, and on - each network generates output vectors at time n in the sequence. These networks follow a multi-layer perceptron structure, and 
the non-linear function for each control unit adopts a sigmoid function ($\sigma$), constraining the vector components to a range between zero and one.
